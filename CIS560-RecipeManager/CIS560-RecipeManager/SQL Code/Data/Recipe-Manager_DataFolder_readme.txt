CIS 560 - Project Team 01

NOTE: Simple data generation scripts are included inside this folder for basic testing purposes, though the real testing occurred using the DataGenerator class as written in the "DataGenerator.cs" file in the main repo in the "DataGenerator" folder.
The default data created by the scripts in this folder are already present in the repo database, but if one wishes to ONLY use the non-generated default data, commenting-out line 35 in the "HomeController.cs" file will prevent the data generation.
